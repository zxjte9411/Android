# Android 程式作業

<br />

Copy your HW#6 to another app and rename the app as HW#7.
Import HW#7 and modify the code according to the following requirements.

1. Change the app title to "作業 七: your name".
2. Change the game rolling-a-dice in which a user can click a Button and the computer will randomly generate a number ranging from 1 to 6. If the generated number is greater than 4 then computer wins. If the number is equal to 3 or 4, then the result is draw. Otherwise, the user wins. Use a Toast to show the game result (i.e., user wins, computer wins, or draw). Update the program and resource accordingly. 
3. Moreover, when the user click the Button, your app shall show a dice-rolling animation in an ImageView. You may refer to Unit024 for drawable animation. 
4. Keep tracking of the game statistics, including the total number of game that has been played and the total number of computer/user win and draw. Use another activity to show the game statistics and provide one Button to show the game statistics. 
5. The layout of the "game-statistics" activity shall use LinearLayout. In addition to show the game statistics, the layout of this activity shall also contain a Button. When the user click that Button, the app will go back to previous activity (i.e., MainActivity).
